This plugin will insert the BoostSuite tracking code on all non-admin pages of your site.

== Description ==

This plugin will insert the BoostSuite tracking code in the <HEAD> section of all non-admin pages on your site.

Please note that the BoostSuite plug-in sends data about your website and its visitors back to the BoostSuite service so that this data can be analyzed and turned into suggestions in your BoostSuite account. This data includes information about each website visitor including their IP address, the URL of the page they are viewing, specific content they are viewing, and the search keywords they used to reach the website. This plug-in also requests data from the BoostSuite service which allows BoostSuite to customize the on-page experience when you run content tests for your visitors through BoostSuite.
